Hi, I’m @RainyCityDiver, I'm new here as of Dec. 30, 2020.
  
I’m interested in programming (duh), and SCUBA diving.
  
Oh you thought I meant Olympic diving? My bad. Platform diving is incredible, but sadly I do not have the inner ear for it (mine dislikes spinning/flipping). I'd make a poor acrobat. Or Spiderman.

I’m currently learning Python3, AWS, and going through the MIT CS50 curriculum. I'm also dabbling in mySQL. Next up in the SCUBA world is Rescue Diver.

How to reach me ... [to be added]
