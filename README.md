  ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @RainyCityDiver, I'm new here as of Dec. 30, 2020.
  ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in ... SCUBA diving (duh). 
Oh you thought I meant Olympic diving? My bad. Platform diving is incredible, 
but sadly I do not have the inner ear for it (I dislike spinning/flipping). 
I'd make a poor acrobat. Or Spiderman.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python3, AWS, and the MIT CS50 curriculum. 

- ðŸ“« How to reach me ... [to be added]
