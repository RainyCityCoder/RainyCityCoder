Hi, I’m RainyCityCoder, a curious, carbon-based coder.

I enjoy computer wrangling and problem solving; in the past I've built and fixed PCs, learned CISCO, and worked in IT support. Programming is a great fit!

I got started with Python before migrating to JavaScript and web development. I'm currently improving my MERN stack (MongoDB, ExpressJS, ReactJS, NodeJS), JavaScript, HTML, and CSS skills. I've also dabbled in SQL, PyScript, and Bash scripting.
