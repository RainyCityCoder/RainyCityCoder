Hi, I’m @RainyCityCoder, a multi-talented human with a strong sense of curiosity. I love exercising it by SCUBA diving and learning new things.

I’m transitioning from automotive into the tech sphere as a web developer. Building a web site that anyone can interact with is highly rewarding.

I enjoy computer wrangling and problem solving; In the past I've built my own PC, learned CISCO, and even worked in IT support. Programming is a great fit! 

Currently learning JavaScript and Flask, and I'm continuing to improve in Python, HTML, and CSS. I've also dabbled in SQL and Linux (including Bash scripting).
