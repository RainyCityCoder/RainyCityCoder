Hi, I’m RainyCityCoder, a multi-talented, naturally curious carbon-based humanoid. I’m transitioning from automotive into tech as a web developer.

I enjoy computer wrangling and problem solving; in the past I've built and fixed PCs, learned CISCO, and worked in IT support. Programming is a great fit!

I got started programming with Python before realizing I preferred web development. I'm currently improving my MERN stack (MongoDB, ExpressJS, ReactJS, NodeJS), JavaScript, HTML, and CSS skills. I've also dabbled in SQL, and Bash scripting.
