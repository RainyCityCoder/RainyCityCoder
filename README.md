Hi, I’m RainyCityCoder. I enjoy ~~long walks on the beach~~ computer wrangling, problem solving, and building tools, especially web-based tools. In the past I've built and fixed PCs, learned CISCO, and worked in IT support.

I got started with Python before migrating to JavaScript and web development. I'm currently improving my MERN stack (MongoDB, ExpressJS, ReactJS, NodeJS), skills. I've also dabbled in SQL, PyScript, and Bash scripting.
