Hi, I’m RainyCityCoder, a multi-talented, naturally curious carbon-based lifeform. I’m transitioning from automotive into tech as a web developer. 

I enjoy computer wrangling and problem solving; In the past I've built and fixed PCs, learned CISCO, and worked in IT support. Programming is a great fit! 

I got started with Python, I'm currently learning Express.js and MongoDB, and I'm continuing to improve in React, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. I've also dabbled in SQL, Bash scripting, and Linux.
