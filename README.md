Hi, I’m RainyCityCoder. I enjoy ~~long walks on the beach~~ problem solving and building things; especially web-based tools. I got started with Python before web development caught my attention. I've completed a bootcamp based on the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) and am enjoying expanding my portfolio. I've also dabbled in MySQL, PyScript, Docker, and Bash scripting. Ask me about my projects!
