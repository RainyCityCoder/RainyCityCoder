Hi, I’m RainyCityCoder. I enjoy ~~long walks on the beach~~ problem solving, and building things, especially web-based tools. In the past I've built and fixed PCs, learned CISCO CCNA, and worked in IT support.

I got started with Python before pivoting to web development with the MERN stack (MongoDB, ExpressJS, ReactJS, NodeJS). I've also dabbled in SQL, PyScript, and Bash scripting. Ask me about my projects!
