Hi, I’m RainyCityCoder. I enjoy ~~long walks on the beach~~ computer wrangling, problem solving, and building things, especially web-based tools. In the past I've built and fixed PCs, learned CISCO, and worked in IT support.

I got started with Python before migrating to web development via a Full-Stack JavaScript course focused on the MERN stack (MongoDB, ExpressJS, ReactJS, NodeJS). I've also dabbled in SQL, PyScript, and Bash scripting. Ask me about my projects!
