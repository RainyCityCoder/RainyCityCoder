Hi, I’m @RainyCityDiver, I'm new here as of Dec. 30, 2020.
  
I’m interested in programming (duh), SCUBA diving, hot chocolate, and other things like science fiction (and fact!), music, and lately; Stoic philosophy. 
  
I’m currently learning Python 3. I'm also dabbling in SQL. Next up in the SCUBA world is Rescue Diver.

How to reach me ... [to be added]
