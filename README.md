Hi, I’m @RainyCityCoder, a multi-talented human with a strong sense of curiosity. I love exercising it by SCUBA diving and learning new things.

I’m transitioning from automotive into the tech sphere as a web developer. Building a web site that one can interact with and see in front of you is highly rewarding.

I enjoy computer wrangling and problem solving; I've built my own PC, learned CISCO, and even worked in IT support in the past. Programming is a great fit! 

Currently learning Python, HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I've also dabbled in SQL and Linux.
