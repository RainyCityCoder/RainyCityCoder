Hi, I’m @RainyCityDiver, I'm interested in programming (duh), SCUBA diving, hot chocolate, and other things like science fiction (and fact!), music, and lately; Stoic philosophy. 
  
I’m currently learning Python 3, HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I've also dabbled in SQL. Next up in the SCUBA world is Rescue Diver.
