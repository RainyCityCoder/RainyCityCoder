Hi, I’m @RainyCityDiver, I'm new here as of Dec. 30, 2020.
  
I’m interested in ... SCUBA diving (duh), and programming. 
  
Oh you thought I meant Olympic diving? My bad. Platform diving is incredible, but sadly I do not have the inner ear for it (it dislikes spinning/flipping). I'd make a poor acrobat. Or Spiderman.

I’m currently learning Python3, AWS, and going through the MIT CS50 curriculum. 

How to reach me ... [to be added]
