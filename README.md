Hi, I’m RainyCityCoder, a multi-talented, curious carbon-based lifeform. I’m transitioning from automotive into tech as a web developer. 

I enjoy computer wrangling and problem solving; In the past I've built PCs, learned CISCO, and even worked in IT support. Programming is a great fit! 

I got started with Python, I'm currently learning React, and I'm continuing to improve in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. I've also dabbled in SQL and Linux (including Bash scripting).
