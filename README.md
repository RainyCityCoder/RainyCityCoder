Hi, I’m @RainyCityDiver, I'm new here as of Dec. 30, 2020.
  
I’m interested in programming (duh), SCUBA diving, hot chocolate, and other things like science fiction (and fact!), music, and lately; Stoic philosophy. 
  
Oh you thought I do Olympic diving? My bad. Platform diving athletes are incredible, but sadly I do not have the inner ear for it (mine dislikes spinning/flipping). I'd make a poor acrobat. Or Spiderman.

I’m currently learning Python3, and going through the MIT CS50 curriculum. I'm also dabbling in SQL. Next up in the SCUBA world is Rescue Diver.

How to reach me ... [to be added]
